//! Pluggable library backends ("media sources").
//!
//! Each source knows how to enumerate songs for the library and how to make a
//! local file appear on disk when the analyzer/player needs to read bytes.
//! The folder source is the original "Select folder" behavior; the Jellyfin
//! and Jellyfin, Navidrome (Subsonic), and Plex sources talk to remote servers over HTTP. The
//! trait stays small so additional servers (Plex, generic Subsonic forks)
//! can drop in without touching downstream code.
