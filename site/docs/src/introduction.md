# Nightingale

**Karaoke from any song in your music library, powered by neural networks.**

Nightingale scans your music folder, separates lead vocals from instrumentals using the UVR Karaoke model (or Demucs), transcribes lyrics with word-level timestamps via WhisperX, and plays it all back with synchronized highlighting, pitch scoring, key/tempo controls, profiles, and dynamic backgrounds.

Ships as a single binary. No manual installation of Python, ffmpeg, or ML models required — everything is downloaded and bootstrapped automatically on first launch.
