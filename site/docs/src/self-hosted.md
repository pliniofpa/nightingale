# Self-Hosted Web Mode

Run Nightingale on a Linux box at home, then open it from phones, laptops, tablets, or TVs on your LAN.

You get one local URL:

```text
http://<hostname>.local
```

Use plain HTTP for browsing, playback, queues, and most features. Use HTTPS if you want browser features like microphone capture, fullscreen, and clipboard (unless they work via http).

## Quick install

On the Linux host:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rzru/nightingale/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

When system changes start, the installer shows the first `sudo` command, asks for confirmation, then prints each admin command before it runs.

When it finishes, open the URL shown by the installer, usually:

```text
http://<hostname>.local
```

The installer is safe to re-run. Re-running upgrades Nightingale and keeps your data.

## What the installer does

It sets up:

- `nightingale.service` — runs the Nightingale web server.
- `caddy.service` — serves Nightingale on HTTP and HTTPS.
- `avahi-daemon` — makes `<hostname>.local` work on your LAN.
- A system user named `nightingale` (optional).
- A default data folder at `/var/lib/nightingale`.

Your music folder is **not** configured by the installer. You choose it in the app.

## Requirements

- Linux host with `systemd`.
- Root access with `sudo`.
- Internet access to download Nightingale and setup dependencies.
- Ports `80`, `443`, and `5353/udp` allowed on your LAN if you use a firewall.
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU for faster analysis.

The installer can install `caddy` and `avahi-daemon` with `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `zypper`, or `apk`. If your distro uses something else, install those packages first, then run the installer.

## First launch

1. Open `http://<hostname>.local` from any device on your LAN.
2. Follow setup in the browser.
3. Choose a data folder with enough space for models, cache, videos, and analysis files.
4. Wait while Nightingale downloads `ffmpeg`, Python, PyTorch, WhisperX, Demucs, UVR models, and other dependencies.
5. Open the library menu, choose a music folder, and scan your songs.

If your songs are on the server at `/srv/music/karaoke`, enter that full path in the app.

## Microphone support and HTTPS

Browsers block microphone capture on normal HTTP pages unless the page is `localhost`. Since `<hostname>.local` is not treated as secure, mic capture needs HTTPS. This can vary per-browser and per-setup, if mic capture works for you via HTTP-connection, feel free to skip this step (If you still want to use it via HTTP you must [config you browser](https://www.windowstechit.com/28309/insecure-origins-treated-as-secure/)).

Nightingale already serves HTTPS at:

```text
https://<hostname>.local
```

Before browsers trust it, install Nightingale's local certificate once on each device.

Download the certificate from your LAN:

```bash
curl -O http://<hostname>.local/root.crt
```

Then trust it:

- **macOS** — open `root.crt`, add it to Keychain, set it to **Always Trust**.
- **iPhone / iPad** — send `root.crt` to the device, install the profile, then enable it in **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**.
- **Windows** — double-click `root.crt`, install it to **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.
- **Android** — install it as a CA certificate in security settings. Some browsers may need their own certificate import too.
- **Linux** — copy it to `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/nightingale.crt`, run `sudo update-ca-certificates`, and import it separately in Firefox if needed.

After that, use `https://<hostname>.local` for microphone scoring.

## Firewall

If your firewall is active, open these inbound LAN ports:

| Port | Protocol | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `80` | TCP | HTTP app access |
| `443` | TCP | HTTPS app access and microphone support |
| `5353` | UDP | `.local` discovery with Avahi / mDNS |

Ubuntu / Debian / Raspberry Pi OS with `ufw`:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp   comment 'nightingale http'
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp  comment 'nightingale https'
sudo ufw allow 5353/udp comment 'nightingale mdns'
sudo ufw reload
```

Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE with `firewalld`:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mdns
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

If your firewall is inactive, you do not need to do anything.

## Music folder permissions

Nightingale runs as the `nightingale` user by default, or any other user you prompt during the setup. That user needs read access to your songs.

For a common `/srv/music/karaoke` folder:

```bash
sudo setfacl -m u:nightingale:rx /srv/music
sudo setfacl -R -m u:nightingale:rx /srv/music/karaoke
```

You can also grant access with normal Unix groups if that fits your setup better.

## Updating

Run the installer again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rzru/nightingale/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This replaces the server binary and restarts Nightingale. Your config, library, cache, and music stay in place.

To install a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rzru/nightingale/master/scripts/install.sh | NIGHTINGALE_VERSION=v1.2.0 bash
```

## Useful commands

```bash
systemctl status nightingale caddy
journalctl -u nightingale -f
journalctl -u caddy -f
sudo systemctl restart nightingale
```

## Change the local name

To use a friendlier URL like `nightingale.local`, follow the setup prompts or use an environmental variable:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rzru/nightingale/master/scripts/install.sh | NIGHTINGALE_HOSTNAME=nightingale.local bash
```

Then open:

```text
http://nightingale.local
```

If your router supports DHCP reservations, reserve a stable IP for the host too.

## Run with Docker

Prefer containers? You can skip the systemd / Caddy / Avahi installer entirely and run the server in Docker (CPU or CUDA/GPU). See [Docker](./docker.md).

## Build from source

Use this if you are testing local changes or no release exists yet:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rzru/nightingale.git
cd nightingale
bash scripts/install.sh --from-source
```

You need `cargo`, `node`, and `pnpm` available in your user shell.

## Advanced installer options

Most users do not need these.

| Variable | Default | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NIGHTINGALE_VERSION` | `latest` | Install a specific GitHub Release tag. |
| `NIGHTINGALE_REPO` | `rzru/nightingale` | Install from another repo. |
| `NIGHTINGALE_HOSTNAME` | `$(hostname -s).local` | Publish a different `.local` name. |
| `NIGHTINGALE_USER` | `nightingale` | Run service as another system user. |
| `NIGHTINGALE_DATA_DIR` | `/var/lib/nightingale` | Bootstrap config and service data path. |
| `NIGHTINGALE_FORCE_AVAHI_HOSTNAME` | unset | Overwrite an existing Avahi hostname override. |
| `NIGHTINGALE_FORCE_CADDYFILE` | unset | Let installer replace an existing Caddyfile after backing it up. |

The installer tries not to overwrite your existing Caddy or Avahi setup. If it detects a conflict, it stops and prints what to fix.

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now nightingale
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/nightingale.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/nightingale /usr/local/bin/nightingale.etag /usr/local/bin/nightingale.version
sudo rm -f /etc/avahi/services/nightingale.service
sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon
```

If the installer created Nightingale's Caddy snippet, remove it and reload Caddy:

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/caddy/Caddyfile.d/nightingale.caddy
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

Data is kept by default. Remove it only if you are done with it:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/nightingale
sudo userdel nightingale
```
