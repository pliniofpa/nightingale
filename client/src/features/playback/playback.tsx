/**
 * Playback route: requires `song` in location state; otherwise redirects home.
 *
 * On reload, Firefox preserves `history.state.song` and Chromium browsers
 * usually do too, so the song reference survives. The playback session itself
 * rebuilds from scratch (`PlaybackInner key={file_hash}` re-mounts a fresh
 * providers tree); the engine reads its inputs from the song hash, which is
 * stable across reloads. The only missing piece historically was a WS race
 * in `PlaybackTransportProvider` (`stems-ready` emitted before the freshly
 * reconnected socket subscribed) — fixed at the source so reloads can resume
 * playback from the beginning.
